# Common mental disorders and additional long-term conditions

#### Status: In progress

## Project Description

Depression and anxiety are common mental disorders, experienced by around 1 in 5 of us in the UK. But the NHS has recognised that mental healthcare services need improvement and will be investing substantially more money in this area over the next 4 years. 

We know that generally, patients coming to the NHS for treatment are increasingly likely to have several medical conditions that they are dealing with. This is also likely to be true for patients with depression or anxiety, but the number of depressed or anxious patients with additional medical conditions is not well understood and neither are their healthcare needs. 

We will describe how many patients with common mental disorders (depression or anxiety) are dealing with additional long-term conditions and whether there are certain groups of patients that are more likely to be affected (e.g. older people or those in more deprived areas). We will describe the demographic characteristics and additional conditions of people with common mental disorders over the last ten years. We will describe how additional conditions and other characteristics affect which types of NHS services patients with common mental disorders are currently using, and how often they use them.  

As the NHS invests more money in improving mental health services, it is important to understand the needs of patients with common mental disorders and the way in which they are using the NHS. This includes understanding how additional long-term conditions can affect the health needs of these patients, so that it is possible target improvements appropriately. 

## Data Sources
We are using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), ISAC protocol number 19_178. This includes linked HES and area deprivation (IMD) data for the subset of patients for whom this is available.

Data used for this analysis were anonymised in line with the ICO's Anonymisation Code of Practice. The data were accessed in The Health Foundation's Secure Data Environment, which is a secure data analysis facility (accredited for the ISO27001 information security standard, and recognised for the NHS Digital Data Security and Protection Toolkit). No information that could directly identify a patient or other individual was used. Variables labelled 'patid' do not refer to NHS IDs or other identifiable patient data.


## How does it work?

What you need to do to reproduce the analysis or re-use the code on your local machine.  

### Requirements

Software or packages that needs to be installed and and how to install them.

For example:
These scripts were written in R version (to be added) and RStudio Version 1.1.383. 
The following R packages (available on CRAN) are needed: 
* [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

### Getting started

Describe the way in which the code can be used.
