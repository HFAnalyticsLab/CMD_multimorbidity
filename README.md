# Common mental disorders and additional long-term conditions

#### Status: Planning

## Project Description

We are in the planning stage of a project looking at the impact of additional long-term conditions on the healthcare needs of patients with common mental disorders. We are applying for permission to access data from Clinical Research Practice Datalink ( [CPRD](https://www.cprd.com/) ) which would allow us to use patient-level data on GP and hospital use to address this topic. 

Currently there is no code available - we plan to use this repo to share the scripts which we will use to process and analyse CPRD data as part of this work. 

## Data Sources
We are currently applying to CPRD for access to data to complete this project. 

## How does it work?

What you need to do to reproduce the analysis or re-use the code on your local machine.  

### Requirements

Software or packages that needs to be installed and and how to install them.

For example:
These scripts were written in R version (to be added) and RStudio Version 1.1.383. 
The following R packages (available on CRAN) are needed: 
* [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

### Getting started

Describe the way in which the code can be used.
