# Common mental disorders and additional long-term conditions

#### Status: Planning

## Project Description

We are in the planning stage of a project looking at the impact of additional long-term conditions on the healthcare needs of patients with common mental disorders. We are applying for permission to access data from Clinical Research Practice Datalink ( [CPRD](https://www.cprd.com/) ) which would allow us to use patient-level data on GP and hospital use to address this topic. 

 
Currently there is no code available - we plan to use this repo to share the scripts which we will use to process and analyse CPRD data as part of this work. 

## Data Sources
We are currently applying to CPRD for access to data to complete this project.
