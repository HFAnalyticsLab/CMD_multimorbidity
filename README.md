# Common mental disorders and additional long-term conditions

#### Status: Planning

## Project Description
Depression and anxiety are common mental disorders, experienced by around 1 in 5 of us in the UK. But the NHS has recognised that mental healthcare services need improvement and will be investing substantially more money in this area over the next 4 years. 

We know that generally, patients coming to the NHS for treatment are increasingly likely to have several medical conditions that they are dealing with. This is also likely to be true for patients with depression or anxiety, but the number of depressed or anxious patients with additional medical conditions is not well understood and neither are their healthcare needs. 

We will describe how many patients with common mental disorders (depression or anxiety) are dealing with additional long-term conditions and whether there are certain groups of patients that are more likely to be affected (e.g. older people or those in more deprived areas). We will describe how additional conditions and other characteristics affect which types of NHS services patients with common mental disorders are using, and how often they use them.  

As the NHS invests more money in improving mental health services, it is important to understand the needs of patients with common mental disorders and the way in which they are using the NHS. This includes understanding how additional long-term conditions can affect the health needs of these patients, so that it is possible target improvements appropriately. 
 
Currently there is no code available - we plan to use this repo to share the scripts which we will use to process and analyse CPRD data as part of this work. 

## Data Sources
Data used for this analysis were anonymised in line with the ICO’s Anonymisation Code of Practice. The data are accessed in The Health Foundation’s Secure Data Environment, which is a secure data analysis facility (accredited for the ISO27001 information security standard, and recognised for the NHS Digital Data Security and Protection Toolkit). No information that could directly identify a patient or other individual is used. For ease of undertaking analysis, data objects may have been labelled e.g. ‘patient_ID’. These do not refer to NHS IDs or other identifiable patient data.

We are using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), ONS mortality and Indices of Multiple Deprivation. Data access for this project has been approved ([ISAC 19_178]. 


## How does it work?

As the data used for this analysis is not publically available, the code cannot be used to replicate the analysis on this dataset. However, with modifications the code will be able to be used on other patient-level CPRD extracts.
